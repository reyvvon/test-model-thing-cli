# Test-Model-Thing (TMT)

[YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/9UERVVwpNew)

This is a small proof-of-concept language model (not an LLM) that aims to incorporate the following (and some smaller features as well):
* Latent-space prediction
* Internal state + recurrent trace units (RTUs)
* Byte input/output
* Continuous data streaming
* Test-time training

It is not a finished work.

The model is built with MLX, so it should run fine on all Apple Silicon devices. MLX on Linux has been tested by community members and it should work fine as well. On Windows, there are a few unofficial work-in-progress Pytorch ports but they aren't 1:1 compatible yet. I have managed to get the model running on WSL however, and it does train.

Being a proof of concept I have only trained a 4.5-million parameter model (keep in mind, GPT-1 was ~117m) for about 12 hours, but there are promising results. The model tends to misspell characters (since it outputs byte-by-byte, rather than token-by-token) but it is able to close quotes/brackets and such. Given further training and scaling up the model more interesting results could occur. I'm also using a very small dataset, so there is a lot more that can be fed into the model.

This model architecture was designed between July and August 2026 by me (a solo high school dev) and some Gemini (only pair programming, no agents). I wrote about a dozen prototypes before finalizing on this architecture. I write READMEs myself without AI.

Feel free to fork the training and benchmark code (everything is under MIT). I really encourage you to try things out and submit issues and pull requests. If you have compute (e.g. you are a lab or just have GPUs lying around), feel free to train larger models for longer periods of time as well, with credit. I really appreciate contributions to the project.

## Model output

For reproduction purposes, the dataset I trained my model on is ```simplewiki-20260801-pages-articles.xml.bz2```, from the Wikipedia dumps. The 4.5m model has ```dim = 512``` and ```layers = 16```.

Below is ```--frozen``` mode output after training a model for 5 minutes (you could train it for much longer, feel free to send in the results as a GitHub issue).

Also below is some results from CoLA after training a model for ~30 minutes. GPT-1, as a comparison point, scored 45.4, so there is still some distance to go.

## Training your own model

Model weights (in ```.safetensors```) are not provided because GitHub doesn't like very large files. But, you can train your own model simply by initializing a ```venv``` and installing dependencies with ```pip install mlx``` on Mac or ```pip install mlx[cuda]``` on Linux with GPU or ```pip install mlx[cpu]``` on Linux with CPU. Then run ```main.py```.

```bash
python main.py <path> train
python main.py <path> chat

# only use crossentropy loss
python main.py <path> chat --ce-only

# does not save to disk
python main.py <path> chat --no-save

# does not modify weights
python main.py <path> chat --frozen

# does not save to disk or modify weights
python main.py <path> chat --no-save --frozen

# benchmark with CoLA
python benchmark.py <path> <epochs> <slice>
```

You will have to configure your own dataset to run dataset mode, but you should be able to run chat mode without modifying anything if you have weights already.

Once it begins training, you can safely ^C the program and it will save weights. It will also periodically save weights every so often. The saved weights include the internal memory so the model will remember that the next time it runs. You can launch into chat mode and the memory should carry on from whatever it was learning in training.

## A graphical view (partially outdated)

_I'm probably going to redo this in Manim or similar software sometime soon. Expect this part to change significantly soon_

Below is an approximate flow chart of the model architecture, made in Apple's Freeform app (excluding the wrapper for dataset cleaning and input/output handling) for reference. Note that the arrow connecting the target latent to the CE loss should instead be the target byte to the CE loss.
